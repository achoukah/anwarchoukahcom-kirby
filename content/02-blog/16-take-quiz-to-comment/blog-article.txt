Sometimes, you read a good article that makes sense, you enjoy it, and the points are well made.

Then... You get to the comments.

How many times have you shook your head in despair at how few commenters have actually read the article before they comment?

That's why I suggest a new way. A better way.

Before being allowed to comment, everyone should take a short quiz with 5 questions about the article. You may then proceed to comment, anonymously if you so choose.

Wouldn't that sort out the internet?
