Sometimes, you read a good article that makes sense, you enjoy it, and the points are well made.

Then... You get to the comments.

> Herp derp. This is a blockquote. The kind you want to go on several lines because the shit is so profound.

> Another paragraph.

How many times have you shook your head in despair at how few commenters have actually read the article before they comment?

```
  code{
    padding: 0 .5rem;
    margin: 0 .5rem;
    border-radius: .2rem;
    border: thin dotted @grey-lt;
    background: @grey-dk;
    font-family: @codefont;
    font-size: .9rem;
    color: @white;
    display: inline-block;
  }

  code.block{
    display: block;
    margin: @unit 0;
  }
```

That's why I suggest a new way. A better way.

Before being allowed to comment, everyone should take a short quiz with 5 questions about the article. You may then proceed to comment, anonymously if you so choose.

Wouldn't that sort out the internet?

The reason I started thinking about this was after reading a well written article by Brianna Wu, Co-Founder/Head of Development of [Giant Spacekat](http://www.revolution60.com/)
