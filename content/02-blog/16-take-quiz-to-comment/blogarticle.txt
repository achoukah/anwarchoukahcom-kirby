Sometimes, you read a good article that makes sense, you enjoy it, and the points are well made.

I read a well written article by [Brianna Wu][1], Co-Founder/Head of Development of [Giant Spacekat](http://www.revolution60.com/) about gender issues among gamers. You should go [read][2] that.

Then... You get to the comments. The first few comments seem to have missed the point completely of the article. Often when it comes to gender issues, a lot of men (although you will also find womenchipping in) will get angry and start shouting that the author is full of shit in the comment section.

Since I first read it, Polygon have disabled comments:

> **Editor's note:** We have disabled comments for this post. While most comments were respectful and within the guidelines of Polygon's TOS, our staff came to the decision that the piece could and should stand without comments. When a contributor wants to share something highly personal with our readership, we want to offer them a place to do that without having their stories called into question, shouted down or dissected (even by the commenters offering support). If you want to continue discussion of this topic, we'd encourage you to share your thoughts in [this thread][3].

I have a suggestion for how to fix it.

Before being allowed to comment, everyone should take a short quiz with 5 questions about the article. You may then proceed to comment, anonymously if you so choose.

This idea does of course not come without problems. I can understand that it will involve a little bit of extra work that might not be feasible if your article output is high. It would probably have to take the form of multiple-choice questions.

But wouldn't that sort out the internet?
