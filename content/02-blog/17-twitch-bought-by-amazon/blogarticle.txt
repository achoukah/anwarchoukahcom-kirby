The web is awash with news that [Amazon] has just aquired [Twitch] for the princely sum of $1bn (Â£600m) right under the nose of Google.

Most journalists appear baffled by this news... To this, all I have to say is that they must not have any children aged between 8 and 14.

My two girls would spend the whole day glued to Twitch, watching these new web celebrities do their thing.

Now don't feel too bad for Google... They're not doing too badly with YouTube. That venerable old website gets plenty of their attention too. The USP that Twitch has to offer, though, is live streaming.

The celebrities' thing, if you aren't aware of it, is to play a game such as Minecraft, or Sim City depending on their proclivities. They wil waffle on, letting their personalities shine.

My girls will continue watching until it's bedtime or until I grab the iPod touch or iPad off them. 

They're just not as interested in TV anymore.

That is why I believe it's a very shrewd move by Amazon, even at that price-point.
