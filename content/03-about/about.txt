## History

He graduated from [LCP &mdash; London College of Printing and Distributive Trades](http://www.arts.ac.uk/lcc/ "London College of Communication") (now called LCC) in 2001.

He also started working for [The Sun](http://thesun.co.uk/ "The Sun website") in 1998 as part of the newly formed web team, back when CSS was just a twinkle in the eye of fellow Norwegian [Håkon Wium Lie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie "Håkin Wium Lie on Wikipedia") and the [WWWC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium "The World Wide Web Consortium on Wikipedia"). Hell, he remembers trying to make sense of tables within tables within tables so deep it would put [Inception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception "The Movie Inception on Wikipedia") to shame.

Originally from Norway, Anwar currently lives in London, UK with his two daughters and lovely wife.
